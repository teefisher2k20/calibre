# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

There are no security specific releases of calibre. Security bugs are fixed
and released just like all other bugs.

## Reporting a vulnerability

To report security vulnerabilities, open an issue in this GitHub repository.

For sensitive security issues, you can use GitHub's private security advisories
feature to report them confidentially.

Security issues will be addressed as quickly as possible. Once confirmed, fixes
will be committed to the main branch. The timeline may vary based on the severity
of the issue and the current development state.
